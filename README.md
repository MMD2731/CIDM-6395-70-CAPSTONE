# Miguel Sanchez

My name is Miguel Sanchez, and my current role is the Vice President of Software Development/Project Management for Core Applications of a regional bank based out of Florida. Within this role I oversee a multitude of workstreams from our Scrum teams that manage the releases of in-house software we have created, working directly with vendors for new technologies and initiatives, enhancing current processes and ultimately preparing our organization for a more flexible and unknown future, with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence. Many of our in-house applications run off Java, JavaScript, C#, and SQL (with an overlaid semantic layer). We leverage various partnerships with Amazon to manage our AWS services and have various EC2 instances where these in house applications reside. I work directly with Networking, Information Security, Enterprise Architecture, Data Engineering, ETL and our Tidal team to ensure all our applications and workflows work effectively and efficiently. My role is a delicate dance where I orchestrate many of the initiatives we have, manage the workload of our development team, manage expectations of the business lines, and maintain a forward-thinking perspective of the “big picture” for our organization. It is also critical in my role to understand the importance of our people and the team because alone we accomplish nothing. The great economist and professor from Harvard Business School, Theodore Levitt once said, “Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things.”
