# **Data Management** 

While working through CIDM-6350 my confidence in SQL skyrocketed and I was able to grasp the understanding of joins (Inner vs Outer) select statements that have order, counts and logic within them, as well as filters to bring in specific data I was needed to comb through. While working through the different SQL functions this course helped me to understand Entity Relationship Diagrams and the importance of primary keys and foreign keys. Dr. Abby Sen was one of the greatest professors I ever had the pleasure of learning from throughout my time in this MSCISBA course. 

In CIDM-6350 "Data and Information Management”, we engaged with a comprehensive curriculum that aligns with various learning objectives crucial for mastering database management and information systems. The course focuses on mapping these objectives to specific assessments, ensuring all of us developed critical skills applicable to real-world scenarios. Throughout the course, we explored the role of database management and the value of information within organizations. We reviewed the history and the current trends of database models. I was able to grasp the concept of relational databases and develop Entity Relationship Diagrams (ER) and Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagrams (EER). We designed relational schemas and evaluated database design quality using normalization rules. I became extremely proficient in designing databases to meet business requirements by utilizing structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating data. I was able to retrieve data from the relational databases I created and worked on through assignments. Furthermore, the course fosters an understanding of current applications of data and information management and incorporated Python integration with SQL databases and enhanced my technical problem-solving skills. I was able to develop a holistic understanding of data and information management, which prepared me for real-world challenges in my current role in my career.

The HBU Database project was one of the most difficult projects I have ever worked on. From creation of the database schema, entity relationship diagrams, third normal form, creation of databases and ultimately testing my Database schema from end-to-end. The most difficult tasks I had to work through was working through referential integrity in SQL. Referential integrity is enforced by foreign key constraints. When a foreign key is defined in a table, it establishes a link between that table and a primary key in another table. The foreign key constraint ensures that any value entered into the foreign key column of one table must already exist in the primary key column of the related table. This prevents the creation of orphaned records in child tables when referenced records are deleted or modified in parent tables. When creating my database project, I had over 11 tables which proved to be extremely difficult for me to avoid referential integrity but through various hours and test-driven development, I was able to achieve the final product of my HBU database. 

I took CIDM-6351, "Business Data Extraction, Transfer and Load (ETL)" with Dr. Humphrey’s and he truly helped me understand and made me feel empowered to learn ETL at my own pace. Dr. Humphreys cares about his students and it shows because the material he covered was not only relevant to the current landscape of the CIS business world but also provided a strong foundational understanding of ETL. This course covered the fundamentals of data engineering and the ETL process. We began with a study of data engineering concepts, including relational databases, SQL, and Python. Homework 1 involved completing Datacamp's Data Engineering certificate, which consisted of 18 courses that delved into SQL, Python, database design, and cloud computing. Homework 2, we focused on importing and cleaning data, honing our skills in efficient Python coding, data ingestion with pandas, and database design through a guided Datacamp project. Afterwards, Homework 3 emphasizes transformation and loading data for visualization, while Homework 4 centers on starting Datacamp's Data Manipulation certificate, encompassing courses in pandas, NumPy, and data manipulation techniques. The final portion of this course focuses on a Data Engineering Project for Homework 5, where I applied my acquired skills within a guided Datacamp project where I used real-world data engineering challenges. 

Throughout this course all the assignments were approximately 120+ hours of course material with over 40 hours of guided-projects and individual assessments. While the course material offered by Datacamp was of very good quality, I believe this course required more of the concepts behind ETL and the theoretical foundations behind the "Why” versus the direct coding. While Datacamp is great, one of the tools that the MSCISBA curriculum used was Google Colab for other courses, where we were able to use a similar function of “Run-Time Systems”, except the Google Colab requires you to install the packages you are looking to implement. Datacamp provides some of the source code and provides hints, but a more prescriptive practice using Google Colab would be beneficial as well (possibly a blended approach). Visual Studio has also proven to be an amazing tool that should be used as well to help get students used to the process of commits between Github and the local machine. 

The Python portion of this curriculum is my weakest aspect and continues to resonate throughout all MSCISBA course curriculums. In my opinion, Python is the gateway into Computer Information Systems, Software and Development. It also dabbles in all areas within the core curriculum of the MSCISBA program. Networking, Data Management, Data Analytics. This rung true as I took CIDM-6330 “Software Engineering and Systems Development” where Python was the foundation. Python, particularly when used with frameworks like Django, has become a cornerstone in various domains due to its versatility and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. In the realm of Networking and Cybersecurity, Python's simplicity and readability make it ideal for developing network automation scripts, security analysis tools, and penetration testing frameworks. Its rich set of libraries, such as Scapy and Nmap, empower cybersecurity professionals to perform tasks like packet manipulation, network scanning, and intrusion detection with ease. In Data Mining and Management, Python's libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn enable efficient data extraction, cleaning, and modeling. Its scalability and compatibility with big data tools like Apache Spark make it a preferred choice for managing large datasets and performing complex analyses. Additionally, Python's integration with databases through frameworks like Django ORM facilitates seamless data storage and retrieval in web applications. For Data Analytics and Business Integration, Python's versatility shines through its ability to handle data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling tasks. Python has various integrations with enterprise systems and APIs facilitates data exchanges and workflow automations, enabling organizations (like my own) to make data-driven decisions and streamline operations effectively. In closing, Python's wide-ranging capabilities and vast community make it an indispensable tool for networking and cybersecurity, data mining and management, data analytics, and business integration. This is why I believe the lack of a Python technical foundation course is a deficient portion of my studies. 

As for Data Management, I currently work for a financial institution and work closely with the Data Management teams working directly with Database Analysts, Engineers and Architects. We are constantly dealing with projects revolving around ETL and Data Management. My increased knowledge in SQL due to my experience in CIDM-6350 has been critical to my success and have been able to provide incredible value to my organization’s data team.
